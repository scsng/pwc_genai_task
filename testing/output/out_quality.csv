Criminal Law;no;What is the principle of legality according to Section 1 of the Hungarian Criminal Code?;"The principle of legality according to the Hungarian Criminal Code is that a person can only be held criminally liable for an act that was punishable by law at the time of its commission. This principle is enshrined in Section 1(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that ""The criminal liability of the perpetrator shall be established only for an act which was punishable under an Act at the time of commission, except for acts punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law."" Additionally, Section 2(2) of the same Act states that ""No penalty shall be imposed and no measure shall be applied due to committing a criminal offence if it was not provided for by an Act at the time of commission or, if section 2(2) is applied, of adjudication."" This principle is also reflected in Article T) of the Fundamental Law, which states that ""Generally binding rules of conduct may be laid down in the Fundamental Law or in laws, adopted by an organ having legislative competence and specified in the Fundamental Law, which are promulgated in the official gazette.""

While it attempts to provide constitutional context, the specific article cited from the Fundamental Law (Article T) is not the most direct one for the principle of legality itself.
Criminal Law;yes;Explain the difference between intentional and negligent commission of a criminal offence. How does the 'liability for result' affect qualifying circumstances?;"The difference between intentional and negligent commission of a criminal offence lies in the level of awareness and intent behind the act. Intentional commission refers to a situation where the perpetrator knowingly and deliberately commits an act that is punishable by law, whereas negligent commission involves a failure to exercise due care or diligence, resulting in an unintended criminal act.

According to the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law and is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [1]. This provision highlights the importance of intent and awareness in determining criminal liability.

Article XXVIII of the Fundamental law provides further clarification on this issue. It states that no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law [2]. This provision suggests that negligence or lack of intent may be a mitigating factor in determining criminal liability.

The 'liability for result' affects qualifying circumstances by imposing stricter legal consequences on the perpetrator if they were at least negligent regarding the result of the criminal offense. This is stated in Section 9 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [1]. Liability for hazardous operations is governed by Section 6:535 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code [2], which holds a person carrying out hazardous activities liable for the resulting damage, unless they can prove that the damage was caused by an unavoidable event outside the scope of the hazardous activity.

In addition, Section 6:147 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code [3] addresses liability in damages in the event of gratuitous contracts. The person undertaking the performance of a service free of charge is liable for the damage incurred in the subject of the service if the obligee proves that the obligor caused the damage by an intentional breach of contract, or failed to provide information on a substantial characteristic of the service which was unknown to the obligee.

Lastly, Section 3:59 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code [4] deals with the liability of the controlling member in the event of liquidation of a controlled member of the group of companies. The controlling member is liable for the claims of creditors not yet satisfied, but can be exempted from liability if they prove that the insolvency of the controlled member was not a result of the uniform business policy of the";2;4;2;2;The answer correctly defines intentional and negligent commission but then largely deviates into irrelevant general Hungarian legal principles and, critically, extensive discussions of civil law provisions when the question is specifically about criminal law. This significantly impacts its correctness and relevance, despite good fluency.
Civil Law;no;According to the Civil Code, when does a person reach majority and what happens if a marriage is declared invalid?;"A személy a törvényes korba a 18. életévét betöltésekor lép be. Azaz, a személy 18. életévét betöltésekor válik törvényes korúvá.

Ha egy házasságot érvénytelennek nyilvánítanak, az érvénytelennek tekinthető, ha az érvénytelenítését a bíróság az érvénytelenítésre irányuló cselekmény (a továbbiakban 'érvénytelenítési eljárás') keretében állapítja meg [1]. Az érvénytelenítésről szóló ítélet mindenki számára kötelező [2]. Az érvénytelen házasság az e törvényben meghatározott jogszabályi következményeket vonja maga után [3]. Ebben az esetben, ha a házasságot érvénytelennek nyilvánítják, a feleségek bármelyike a házasság érvénytelenítéséről szóló ítélet megalapozottságának időpontjában, vagy ha az érvénytelenítését a haláluk után állapították meg, a házasság megszűnésének időpontjában, a házasság megszűnésétől számítottan a házasság megszűnésének időpontjában fennálló jogokat érvényesítheti, mintha a házasság a bíróság által megszüntetett volna [4].

Civil Law;yes;Distinguish between legal capacity and capacity to act under the Civil Code. What specific juridical acts can a minor with limited capacity to act perform without their statutory representative?;"The legal capacity and capacity to act are two distinct concepts under the Civil Code. Legal capacity refers to the ability of a person to have rights and obligations under the law, while capacity to act refers to the ability to perform specific legal acts, such as concluding contracts or making wills.

A minor with limited capacity to act can perform certain juridical acts without their statutory representative, but the specific acts are not specified in the provided documents. However, according to the Hungarian Criminal Code, a minor with limited capacity to act can be taken away from their statutory representative without punishment, as stated in Section 211(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code.

Public Procurement;yes;How is 'innovation' defined in the Public Procurement Act, and what are the specific exclusions from the definition of a 'subcontractor'?;"The Public Procurement Act does not explicitly define 'innovation', but it mentions the 'innovation partnership' as a type of public procurement procedure [1]. The exact definition of innovation is not provided.

The specific exclusions from the definition of a 'subcontractor' include:

* Any part (parts) of the concession for the fulfilment of which a tenderer (candidate) intends to use a subcontractor [1].
* The subcontractors to be used for such parts, where already known at the time of submitting the tender or request to participate [2].
* A tenderer, candidate, subcontractor, or organisation certifying suitability that is subject to a ground for exclusion [3].
* A tenderer, candidate, subcontractor, or organisation certifying suitability where a ground for exclusion arises during the procedure [4].
* Members of the board of trustees who are subject to grounds for exclusion or conflicts of interest [5].

Labor Law;no;According to Section 2 of the Labor Code, what specific groups and entities are covered by the Act?;"The Hungarian Labor Code covers specific groups and entities, including:

Workers who normally work in Hungary, unless otherwise provided [1].
Persons who are employed by an employer with a registered office or independent establishment in Hungary [2].
Employees who may bring an action concerning their claims arising under Section 295 in connection with their employment in Hungary before the Hungarian court [3].

It incorrectly cites information from Section 3 and Section 285, with the third point being about jurisdiction rather than who is covered by the Act.
Labor Law;yes;Under what conditions can an employer restrict a worker's personal rights, and what conduct is a worker prohibited from engaging in regarding the employer's reputation and economic interests?;"The Hungarian Labor Code allows employers to restrict a worker's personal rights in certain circumstances. According to Section 3:328 of the Civil Code, employers can require workers to perform mandatory juridical acts or acts relating to the cooperative without delay [3]. Additionally, written juridical acts sent by mail shall be deemed received by the recipient having his address in Hungary on the date indicated on the acknowledgement of receipt, and on the fifth working day following their dispatch if sent by registered mail, unless proven to the contrary [3].

Workers are prohibited from engaging in any conduct that may infringe upon or jeopardize the rightful economic interests of the employer for up to two years following termination of the employment relationship, as stated in Section 228(1) of the Labor Code [1]. This includes any actions that may harm the employer's reputation or economic interests.

Fundamental Law;yes;Describe the core principles of Hungary's statehood including the source of power, the form of government, and the State's position on the 1949 communist constitution as stated in the National Avowal.;"The core principles of Hungary's statehood are based on the division of powers and the protection of individual rights. The Fundamental Law, Article A) states that the functioning of the Hungarian State shall be based on the principle of the division of powers, and no one shall act with the aim of acquiring or exercising power by force. Everyone shall have the right and obligation to resist such attempts in a lawful way [1].

Hungary's government is a republic, as stated in Article A) of the Fundamental Law, which specifies that Hungary shall be an independent, democratic rule-of-law State with a republican form of government [2].

The source of power in Hungary's government is the people. According to Article A) of the Fundamental Law, the source of public power shall be the people, and the power shall be exercised by the people through elected representatives or, in exceptional cases, directly [3].

Hungary's position on the 1949 communist constitution is not explicitly mentioned in the National Avowal. However, it does state that the Hungarian people ""acknowledge the sovereignty of the Hungarian people"" and ""declare that the Hungarian State shall be a democratic, secular, and independent republic"" [4]. Beyond these provisions, the provided documents do not specify further details on Hungary's position on the 1949 communist constitution.

Legal Principles;yes;Compare how the principle of 'good faith and fair dealing' is described across the Civil Code, Labor Code, and Public Procurement Act.;"The principle of 'good faith and fair dealing' is described differently across the Civil Code, Labor Code, and Public Procurement Act.

In the Civil Code, it is described as a requirement for parties to act honestly and fairly when exercising rights and fulfilling obligations [1]. It also prohibits actions that are contrary to previous conduct that the other party could reasonably rely on [2]. Additionally, organisations can contest unfair contract terms that violate this principle [3] and [4].

In the Labor Code, this principle is a fundamental principle that employers and employees must adhere to in their interactions with each other [1]. It requires both parties to act honestly, transparently, and with integrity.

In the Public Procurement Act, the principle of 'good faith and fair dealing' is a fundamental principle that applies to all procurement procedures [1]. It requires contracting authorities and economic operators to act in good faith, transparency, and fairness in all their dealings.

Criminal Law;yes;In which specific cases does Hungarian criminal law apply to acts committed abroad by persons who are not Hungarian nationals?;"The Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed abroad by persons who are not Hungarian nationals in the following specific cases:

Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law and is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [1]. 

Additionally, Article XXVIII of the Fundamental Law provides an exception for extraordinary cases of legal remedy laid down in an Act, where no one shall be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence for which they have already been finally acquitted or convicted in Hungary or, within the scope specified in an international treaty and a legal act of the European Union, in another State, as provided for by an Act [2].

Civil Law;no;What is the legal status of a human foetus and who is entitled to request the appointment of its guardian?;"The legal status of a human foetus is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, but it is considered a child and entitled to protection and care from the moment of conception, as stated in Article XVI of the Fundamental Law of Hungary [1]. However, the documents do not specify who is entitled to request the appointment of a guardian for a human foetus.

The Act on the Protection of Minors mentions that the court may appoint a guardian for a minor if it is in the best interests of the child [2], and the Act on Guardianship and Custody states that a guardian may be appointed for a minor if the parents are unable to care for the child [3]. Beyond these provisions, the provided documents do not specify further details on who is entitled to request the appointment of a guardian for a human foetus.
