Define the principle of legality in criminal law.;no;"The principle of legality in criminal law is a fundamental concept that ensures individuals can only be held criminally liable for acts that were punishable by law at the time of their commission. This principle is enshrined in Section 1(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that criminal liability can only be established for an act that was punishable under an Act at the time of commission, except for acts punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law [1].

Furthermore, the principle of legality also applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, which are punishable under Hungarian law [2]. In such cases, the criminal proceedings shall be launched by the Prosecutor General [3].

According to Section 2(2) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, the new criminal law shall apply if an act is not a criminal offence under the new criminal law in force at the time of adjudicating the act, or is to be adjudged more leniently [1]. This means that if the new law is more lenient, it will be applied.

Additionally, Section 2(3) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code states that the new criminal law shall apply retroactively for adjudicating an act punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law if the act was not punishable under the Hungarian criminal law at the time of commission [2]. This implies that if the act was not punishable under the old law, the new law will be applied.

What is the definition of an intentional offence?;no;"The definition of an intentional offence is an act that is committed with the intention of causing harm or danger to society, as defined in Article XXVIII(4) of the Fundamental Law [1]. This provision states that no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law.

An intentional criminal offence is also defined in Section 3(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that Hungarian criminal law shall apply to acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law [2].

Furthermore, an intentional criminal offence is punishable under the Hungarian law, as stated in Section 3(2) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [3]. This provision also specifies that acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, are punishable under the Hungarian law.

However, Article XXVIII of the Fundamental law states that no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law [1]. This implies that a negligent offence is not a criminal offence if it did not exist at the time of the act.

The Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code suggests that criminal law applies to acts that constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law, regardless of where they were committed [2-4]. However, these provisions do not explicitly mention negligent offences.

In summary, the provided documents do not explicitly define negligent offences, but they suggest that criminal law applies to acts that constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law.

This provision is based on Section 313(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that a person who assaults, deprives of his personal freedom, or endangers an internationally protected person staying in Hungary is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment for one to five years [4]. This implies that criminal liability may begin at the age of 14, as the punishment is applicable to persons who commit the offence while staying in Hungary.

What are the legal consequences of 'liability for result'?;no;"The legal consequences of 'liability for result' are as follows:

Liability for result as a qualifying circumstance shall only be applied if the perpetrator was at least negligent regarding the result [1]. This means that if the perpetrator was not negligent, they cannot be held liable for the result of their actions.

In addition, contracts that violate the law or are concluded by circumventing the law shall be null and void unless the law attaches other legal consequences to it [2]. This means that if a contract is found to be in violation of the law, it may be declared null and void, regardless of any other legal consequences that may be attached to it.

The liability for result is commonly applied in certain situations, but it is not specifically tied to particular industries or professions. However, there are some relevant provisions that may be of interest.

According to Section 187 of the Labor Code, when establishing responsibility and/or the amount of damages, all circumstances of the case shall be taken into consideration, including those that may have influenced the safe and proper administration of inventories [3]. This suggests that the liability for result may be relevant in situations where the employee's actions or omissions have led to damage or loss.

In the context of criminal law, Section 9 of the Criminal Code states that the more severe legal consequences attached to the result of a criminal offence, as a qualifying circumstance, shall only be applied if the perpetrator was at least negligent regarding the result [4]. This provision does not specifically address industries or professions, but it does highlight the importance of negligence in determining liability for result.

Finally, Section 166 of the Labor Code provides that the employer shall be liable to provide compensation for damages caused in connection with an employment relationship [5]. However, the employee shall be relieved of liability if able to prove that the damage occurred in consequence of unforeseen circumstances beyond his control, and there had been no reasonable cause to take action for preventing or mitigating the damage [5].

In terms of industries or professions, there is no specific information provided in the available documents. However, the provisions mentioned above may be relevant in certain contexts.

The concept of ""liability for result"" intersects with concepts like negligence and strict liability in the following ways:

Liability for result as a qualifying circumstance is only applied if the perpetrator was at least negligent regarding the result, as stated in Section 9 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [1]. This means that if the perpetrator was not negligent, they cannot be held liable for the result.

Define 'attempt' in the context of criminal law.;no;"The term 'attempt' in the context of criminal law refers to a person's actions that are intended to commit a crime, but do not result in the completion of the offense. This is in accordance with Section 4(4) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that a person shall not be liable to punishment for attempt if the criminal offense is not completed due to their voluntary abandonment or if they voluntarily avert the occurrence of the result [1]. However, if the attempt constitutes a criminal offense in and of itself, the perpetrator shall be punished for that criminal offense [2].

What is the difference between a perpetrator and an accomplice?;no;"The difference between a perpetrator and an accomplice is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, we can infer some information from the content.

A perpetrator is someone who commits a criminal offence, as mentioned in Section 3(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [1]. This includes criminal offences committed in Hungary, on vessels flying the flag of Hungary, or on aircrafts flying the flag of Hungary, being outside the territory of Hungary, and acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law.

On the other hand, an accomplice is not explicitly defined in the provided documents. However, we can infer that an accomplice is someone who assists or aids a perpetrator in committing a criminal offence. This is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred from the content of the documents.

How does the Hungarian Criminal Code define 'justifiable defence'?;no;"The Hungarian Criminal Code does not explicitly define 'justifiable defence'. However, it does discuss the territorial and personal scope of the code, which may be relevant in certain situations.

Hungarian criminal law applies to criminal offences committed in Hungary, on vessels flying the flag of Hungary, or on aircrafts flying the flag of Hungary, being outside the territory of Hungary [1]. It also applies to acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law [2]. Additionally, Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law and is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [3].

The conditions for justifiable defence are as follows: justifiable defence is not committed if the use of violence or threat is a permitted means of enforcing the claim [4]. The punishment for self-administered justice is imprisonment for two to eight years if the criminal offence is committed with a weapon, with an instrument capable of causing death, by a group, or against a person who is incapable of self-defence [5]. Acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, which are punishable under the Hungarian law, are also punishable [6].

There are several exceptions to justifiable defence, including Article 1 of the Additional Protocol II of the conventions specified in point a) [7], a state of war [8], a state of emergency [9], and the deployment of the Hungarian Defence Forces abroad regarding war crimes and military criminal offences [10]. Additionally, Hungarian criminal law does not apply to acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act is not punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [11]. Defence counsels shall not be held liable for their opinion expressed while providing legal defence [12]. No one shall be considered guilty until their criminal liability has been established by the final and binding decision of a court [13].

Finally, with the exception of extraordinary cases of legal remedy laid down in an Act, no one shall be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence for which they have already been finally acquitted or convicted in Hungary or, within the scope specified in an international treaty and a legal act of the European Union, in another State, as provided for by an Act [14].

Evaluate the criteria for 'abandonment of attempt' and its legal consequences.;yes;"The criteria for 'abandonment of attempt' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the concept of 'abandonment of attempt' is related to the criminal law and the criteria for its application would typically involve the intent to commit a crime and the subsequent abandonment of that intent.

The Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code focuses on the territorial and personal scope of Hungarian criminal law, as well as specific crimes such as treachery and treason. However, there is no mention of the criteria for 'abandonment of attempt'.

The legal consequences of 'abandonment of attempt' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code does provide information on the scope of expungement and the adverse legal consequences of having been convicted.

According to Section 88, the provision on enforcement of a suspended sentence shall apply accordingly to ordering the enforcement of a sentence suspended due to a pardon [1]. This suggests that the consequences of abandoning an attempt may be related to the enforcement of a suspended sentence.

Additionally, the Act states that a convict who has attained the age of eighteen years at the time of commission shall not be relieved of the adverse legal consequences of having a criminal record if he was sentenced to imprisonment to be served for more than five years for certain criminal offences [2]. This provision does not directly address the consequences of abandoning an attempt, but it may be relevant in determining the legal consequences of such an action.

Explain the territorial and personal scope of the Hungarian Criminal Code, specifically concerning non-nationals abroad.;yes;"The territorial scope of the Hungarian Criminal Code applies to acts committed abroad by non-nationals in specific situations. According to Section 3(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law and is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [1]. This provision is in accordance with the rules of international private law.

Additionally, Section 3(1) also states that Hungarian criminal law applies to criminal offences committed in Hungary, on vessels flying the flag of Hungary, or on aircrafts flying the flag of Hungary, being outside the territory of Hungary [2]. This means that if a non-national commits a crime on a Hungarian vessel or aircraft outside of Hungary, they can still be held accountable under Hungarian law.

Furthermore, Section 3(2) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code states that Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, which are punishable under the Hungarian law [3]. This provision highlights the importance of protecting Hungarian citizens and interests abroad.

In the case of treason, Section 258(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code states that a Hungarian citizen who, for the purpose of violating the independence, territorial integrity or constitutional order of Hungary, establishes or keeps contact with a foreign government or foreign organisation is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment for five to fifteen years [4].

Compare the concepts of 'instigator' and 'accessory' under Section 14.;yes;"The concepts of 'instigator' and 'accessory' under Section 14 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code are as follows:

An instigator is a person who intentionally induces another person to commit a criminal offence, as defined in Section 14(1) [1]. On the other hand, an abettor is a person who intentionally provides assistance for the commission of a criminal offence, as defined in Section 14(2) [2]. Both instigators and abettors are considered accessories, and they shall be subject to the same penalty range as offenders, as stated in Section 14(3) [3].

Discuss the conditions under which 'coercion or threat' excludes punishability.;yes;"The conditions under which 'coercion or threat' excludes punishability are outlined in Section 19(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code. According to this provision, a person shall not be liable to punishment if they commit a punishable act under coercion or threat which prevents them from acting in line with their own will [1]. This provision is also listed as one of the reasons for excluding or limiting liability to punishment in Section 15 of the same Act [2].

The exclusion of punishability due to 'coercion or threat' has some limitations. According to Section 19 (2) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, the punishment may be reduced without limitation if the coercion or threat limits the ability of the perpetrator of a criminal offence to act in line with his own will [3]. Additionally, Section 15 of the same Act lists coercion or threat as one of the reasons for excluding or limiting liability to punishment [4]. Furthermore, Section 19 (1) states that a person shall not be liable to punishment if he commits a punishable act under coercion or threat which prevents him from acting in line with his own will [5].

The concept of ""coercion or threat"" as a reason for excluding or limiting liability to punishment is mentioned in the following provisions: Coercion or threat is a valid reason for excluding liability to punishment under Section 15 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [6]. This provision states that a person shall not be liable to punishment if they commit a punishable act under coercion or threat which prevents them from acting in line with their own will [7].

Explain the statute of limitations for the punishability of criminal offences.;yes;"The statute of limitations for the punishability of criminal offences in Hungary varies depending on the type of offence. For criminal offences specified in Chapter XXVII, liability to punishment becomes statute-barred after twelve years [1]. However, liability to punishment shall not become statute-barred for criminal offences specified in Chapters XIII and XIV [2]. For damages caused by a criminal offence, the claim shall only lapse at the time when that criminal offence becomes no longer subject to punishment due to the lapse of time, if this period of time is longer than five years [3]. In general, liability to punishment shall become statute-barred after a period corresponding to the maximum of the penalty range, but at least after five years, with exceptions specified in paragraphs (2) to (3) [4].

The statute of limitations regarding liability to punishment is interrupted if the court, prosecution service, investigating authority, or a foreign authority takes any criminal procedural act against the perpetrator, and it starts again on the day of interruption (Section 28(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code) [5]. Additionally, no one shall be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence for which they have already been finally acquitted or convicted in Hungary or another State, as provided for by an Act (Article XXVIII(6) of the Fundamental Law) [6].

There are exceptions to the general rule. For criminal offences specified in Chapter XXVII, liability to punishment becomes statute-barred after twelve years [7]. Liability to punishment shall not become statute-barred for criminal offences specified in Chapters XIII and XIV [8]. Furthermore, the statute of limitations regarding a criminal offence specified in paragraphs (1) to (4) of the section on facilitating and assisting illegal immigration commences on the day when the main case is finished [9].

The Hungarian Defence Forces are responsible for the military defence of the country's independence, territorial integrity, and borders, as well as participating in collective defence and peacekeeping tasks arising from international treaties (Fundamental Law, The Hungarian Defence Forces) [8]. The law also allows for the exercise of some competences jointly with other Member States through the institutions of the European Union (Article H(2)) [9].

Article XXVII guarantees the right to move freely and choose one's place of residence freely for everyone residing lawfully in the territory of Hungary [10]. Additionally, every Hungarian citizen has the right to enjoy the protection of Hungary during their stay abroad [11].

The Hungarian government has established various international organizations and entities to protect the rights of Hungarians living beyond the borders. The Hungarian Defence Forces are directed by the National Assembly, the President of the Republic, the National Defence Council, the Government, or the minister vested with the relevant functions and powers [12]. Hungary also grants asylum to non-Hungarian nationals who are persecuted in their country or in the country of their habitual residence for reasons of race, nationality, the membership of a particular social group, religious or political beliefs, or have a well-founded reason to fear direct persecution if they do not receive protection from their country of origin, nor from any other country [13]. Furthermore, Hungary strives to provide social security to all of its citizens, including those living abroad, and every Hungarian citizen shall be entitled to assistance in the event of maternity, illness, invalidity, disability, widowhood, orphanage, and unemployment for reasons outside of their control [14].

Explain the principle of division of powers as stated in Article C.;no;"The principle of division of powers is based on the idea that power should be distributed among different branches of government to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful. This principle is enshrined in the Fundamental Law of Hungary, Article C), Section 1, which states that ""The functioning of the Hungarian State shall be based on the principle of the division of powers.""

This principle is also reflected in the Act I of 2012 on the Labor Code, Section 3(1), which states that ""The provisions of this Act shall apply having regard to the rules of international private law."" This suggests that the division of powers is not limited to the government, but also applies to the relationship between different legal systems.

In addition, the Fundamental Law of Hungary, Article N), Section 1, states that ""Hungary shall observe the principle of balanced, transparent and sustainable budget management."" This principle is also related to the division of powers, as it requires that different branches of government work together to manage the budget in a balanced and transparent way.

The Avowal also recognizes the role of national minorities living in Hungary as part of the Hungarian political community and commits to promoting and safeguarding their languages and cultures [2]. Furthermore, it believes that national culture is a rich contribution to European unity and respects the freedom and culture of other nations [3].

Analyze the state's obligation regarding the protection of national identity and the historic constitution.;yes;"The state's obligation regarding the protection of national identity and the historic constitution is rooted in the Fundamental Law. The state must protect its citizens, including their Hungarian citizenship, and ensure the continuity of the nation's statehood and unity. This is a fundamental obligation of the State, as stated in the Fundamental Law [1]. The state must also protect the Hungarian language and ensure that the child of a Hungarian citizen is a Hungarian citizen by birth.

The historic constitution of Hungary has undergone several amendments that impact national identity protection. The Third Amendment to the Fundamental Law, the Fourth Amendment to the Fundamental Law, the Fifth Amendment to the Fundamental Law, the Sixth Amendment to the Fundamental Law, the Seventh Amendment to the Fundamental Law, the Eighth Amendment to the Fundamental Law, and the Ninth Amendment to the Fundamental Law have all been enacted, as in force on 23 December 2020 [1]. The Fundamental Law of Hungary honours the achievements of the historic constitution and the Holy Crown, which embodies the constitutional continuity of Hungary's statehood and the unity of the nation [2]. It also holds that the protection of the nation's identity rooted in the historic constitution is a fundamental obligation of the State [3].

The state's obligation to protect national identity is influenced by several international agreements and laws. The Fundamental Law of Hungary states that natural resources, biodiversity, and cultural artefacts are the common heritage of the nation, and it is the obligation of the State and everyone to protect and maintain them for future generations [4]. The Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code emphasizes the protection of fundamental rights, independence, territorial integrity, economy, and national assets of the country, taking into account Hungary's obligations under international and European Union law [5].

If the state fails to protect national identity, it may lead to a loss of trust among citizens, erosion of national unity, and potentially even the loss of Hungarian citizenship for certain individuals. This could have significant consequences for the state's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and economic stability.

Define the principle of legality in criminal law.;no;"The principle of legality in criminal law is a fundamental concept that ensures individuals can only be held criminally liable for acts that were punishable by law at the time of commission. This principle is enshrined in Section 1(1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, which states that criminal liability can only be established for an act that was punishable under an Act at the time of commission, except for acts punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law [1].

Furthermore, Section 2(2) of the same Act provides that no penalty shall be imposed and no measure shall be applied due to committing a criminal offence if it was not provided for by an Act at the time of commission or, if Section 2(2) is applied, of adjudication [2].

In addition, the Act CXLIII of 2015 on public procurement specifies that a person with similar decision-making powers under its personal law within the last five years for committing a criminal offence mentioned in paragraph (1) a) , and he has not been exempted from the adverse legal consequences of having a criminal record, or b) the final and binding court judgment for committing a criminal offence specified in paragraph (1) a) was passed in the last five years, or any shorter period required for being exempted from the adverse legal consequences of having a criminal record regarding the given criminal offence [3].

When does the criminal law in force at the time of adjudication apply instead of the law at the time of commission?;no;"The criminal law in force at the time of adjudication applies instead of the law at the time of commission in the following situations:

The new criminal law applies retroactively for adjudicating an act punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law if the act was not punishable under the Hungarian criminal law at the time of commission [1].

A criminal offence shall be adjudicated under the criminal law in force at the time of commission, with the exceptions specified in paragraphs (2) to (3) [2]. If an act is not a criminal offence under the new criminal law in force at the time of adjudicating the act, or is to be adjudged more leniently, the new criminal law shall apply [2].

Acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, which are punishable under the Hungarian law, are subject to the new criminal law [3].

Serious criminal offences laid down in an Act which were committed against Hungary or persons under the communist dictatorship in the name or in the interest of, or in agreement with the party-state and which were left unprosecuted for political reasons by ignoring the Act on criminal law in force at the time of commission, shall not be considered as time-barred [4]. These criminal offences shall become time-barred on the expiry of the period determined in the Act on criminal law in force at the time of commission, to be calculated as of the day of the entry into force of the Fundamental Law, provided that they would have become time-barred by 1 May 1990 under the Act on criminal law in force at the time of commission [4].

What are the legal consequences of 'liability for result'?;no;"The legal consequences of 'liability for result' are as follows:

Liability for result as a qualifying circumstance shall only be applied if the perpetrator was at least negligent regarding the result [1]. This is in accordance with Section 9 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code.

In civil law, liability for hazardous operations is governed by Section 6:535 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code. A person carrying out hazardous activities shall compensate for the resulting damage, unless they can prove that the damage was caused by an unavoidable event outside the scope of the hazardous activity [2].

Furthermore, Section 6:147 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code addresses liability in damages in the event of gratuitous contracts. A person undertaking the performance of a service free of charge shall be required to compensate for the damage caused by their service to the assets of the obligee, unless they can prove that they were not at fault [3].

Additionally, Section 3:59 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code imposes liability on the controlling member of a group of companies in the event of liquidation of a controlled member. The controlling member shall be liable for the claims of creditors not yet satisfied, unless they can prove that the insolvency of the controlled member was not a result of the uniform business policy of the group of companies [4].

In the context of criminal law, liability for result is applied when the perpetrator was at least negligent regarding the result, as stated in Section 9 of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [5]. 

In civil law, liability for result is applied in cases of gratuitous contracts, where the person undertaking the performance of a service free of charge is liable for the damage incurred in the subject of the service if the obligee proves that the obligor caused the damage by an intentional breach of contract or failed to provide information on a substantial characteristic of the service, as stated in Section 6:147 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code [6]. 

Additionally, liability for result is applied in cases of hazardous operations, where a person carrying out hazardous activities shall compensate for the resulting damage, as stated in Section 6:535 of the Act V of 2013 on the Civil Code [7].

However, if the attempt constitutes a criminal offence in and of itself, the perpetrator shall be punished for that criminal offence [2].

How does the Hungarian Criminal Code define 'justifiable defence'?;no;"The Hungarian Criminal Code does not explicitly define 'justifiable defence'. However, Article XXVIII of the Fundamental Law [1] and the Territorial and personal scope section of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code [2] provide some related information.

According to Article XXVIII, no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law [3]. Additionally, the right to defence is guaranteed at all stages of the criminal proceedings [4].

The Territorial and personal scope section states that Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law and is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed [5].

The conditions for justifiable defence in the Hungarian Criminal Code are not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, the concept of justifiable defence is generally understood to be a defence that excuses an individual from criminal liability when they have acted in response to a threat or danger.

The Hungarian Criminal Code has several exceptions to justifiable defence. Article XXVIII of the Fundamental Law provides that no one shall be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence for which they have already been finally acquitted or convicted in Hungary or another State, as provided for by an Act [6]. This exception applies to extraordinary cases of legal remedy laid down in an Act [7].

Additionally, Article XXVIII states that no one shall be considered guilty until their criminal liability has been established by the final and binding decision of a court [8]. This means that a person cannot be held guilty of a crime until their guilt has been proven in a court of law.

Furthermore, Article XXVIII also provides that persons subject to criminal proceedings shall have the right to defence at all stages of the procedure [9]. Defence counsels shall not be held liable for their opinion expressed while providing legal defence [10].

The Hungarian Criminal Code distinguishes between justifiable defence and self-defence by considering the circumstances of the situation. Justifiable defence is allowed when a person is incapable of self-defence or unable to express their will [11]. This includes cases where the perpetrator consumed drugs before the act, in a manner that can be connected to the commission of the act [11]. Self-defence, on the other hand, is not explicitly defined in the provided documents.

The justifiable defence is not applicable in the following circumstances in the Hungarian Criminal Code:

Evaluate the criteria for 'abandonment of attempt' and its legal consequences.;yes;"The criteria for 'abandonment of attempt' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the concept of 'abandonment of attempt' might be related to the provisions regarding the temporal and territorial scope of criminal law.

According to Article XXVIII (4) of the Fundamental Law, no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law or, within the scope specified in an international treaty and a legal act of the European Union, under the law of another State [1]. This provision suggests that the criminal law applies to acts that were not punishable at the time of commission.

Additionally, Article XXVIII (6) of the Fundamental Law states that no one shall be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted in Hungary or, within the scope specified in an international treaty and a legal act of the European Union, in another State, as provided for by an Act [2]. This provision implies that there are certain circumstances under which an individual cannot be prosecuted or convicted for a criminal offence.

The temporal scope of the new criminal law, as stated in Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, section 3, is that it shall apply retroactively for adjudicating an act punishable under the generally recognised rules of international law if the act was not punishable under the Hungarian criminal law at the time of commission [3].

However, the specific criteria for 'abandonment of attempt' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question based on the information available.

The legal consequences of 'abandonment of attempt' are not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code does provide information on the scope of expungement, treachery, and the adverse legal consequences of having been convicted.

Additionally, Hungarian criminal law applies to criminal offences committed in Hungary, on vessels flying the flag of Hungary, or on aircrafts flying the flag of Hungary, being outside the territory of Hungary [2]. Furthermore, Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law [3]. Section 309 of the Act also provides that the provisions laid down in this Chapter shall apply accordingly to members of authorities of foreign states pursuing any task relating to the administration of justice or law enforcement proceeding, under an Act, within the territory of Hungary [4].

The personal scope of the Hungarian Criminal Code refers to the individuals or entities to whom the code applies. According to the provisions, Hungarian criminal law applies to acts committed by Hungarian nationals abroad if the act constitutes a criminal offence under Hungarian law [1]. Criminal offences committed in Hungary, on vessels flying the flag of Hungary, or on aircrafts flying the flag of Hungary, being outside the territory of Hungary, are also within the scope of the code [2]. Furthermore, acts committed by persons other than Hungarian nationals abroad against a Hungarian national, or a legal person or other legal entity without legal personality established under Hungarian law, which are punishable under the Hungarian law, are also covered [3].

In the case of a dispute related to the Hungarian Labor Code, the claim must be filed within 3 months from the date of the last payment [4]. If the claim is filed after this deadline, it may be considered invalid.

Compare the concepts of 'instigator' and 'accessory' under Section 14.;yes;"The concepts of 'instigator' and 'accessory' have distinct meanings under the Criminal Code.

An instigator is considered an accessory to the crime, as defined in Section 12 of the Criminal Code [1]. Instigators and abettors are treated similarly in this context. Additionally, Section 9 of the Criminal Code states that an instigator or abettor shall not be liable to punishment if they commit the criminal offence for property originating from a punishable act committed by them [2].

On the other hand, the concept of 'accessory' under Section 14 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, the term 'accessory' is mentioned in the context of 'Accessory after the fact' in the Criminal Code, which states that the perpetrator is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment for up to three years if the criminal offence of accessory after the fact is committed for gain [3]. The Civil Code also mentions 'components, accessories and benefits' in the context of pledged items, stating that the lien shall not extend to the components, accessories and benefits that have been separated from the real estate according to the rules of normal operation before the right to satisfaction can be exercised [4].

Discuss the conditions under which 'coercion or threat' excludes punishability.;yes;"The conditions under which 'coercion or threat' excludes punishability are outlined in Section 19 (1) of the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code. According to this provision, a person shall not be liable to punishment if they commit a punishable act under coercion or threat which prevents them from acting in line with their own will [1]. Additionally, the punishment may be reduced without limitation if the coercion or threat limits the ability of the perpetrator of a criminal offence to act in line with their own will [2].

The law defines 'coercion or threat' in this context as a situation where a person is forced to act against their will due to violence or intimidation. This can include situations where a person is coerced by another person or by circumstances to commit a punishable act.

Article XXVIII (4) of the Fundamental Law states that no one shall be held guilty of, or be punished for, an act which, at the time when it was committed, did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law [3].

The use of coercion or threat as a defense in cases involving minors or individuals with diminished capacity is not explicitly addressed in the provided documents. However, it is mentioned that minors having limited capacity to act may make juridical acts on behalf of themselves in certain situations, such as disposing of their income earned from working [4]. Additionally, the Fundamental Law mentions a civil defense obligation for adult Hungarian citizens with domicile in Hungary, but this does not directly relate to the use of coercion or threat as a defense [5].

The provided documents do not directly address the issue of coercion or threat in relation to punishability. However, they do contain provisions related to criminal liability and punishment.

Active bribery in court or in authority proceedings in the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code provides that the punishment of the perpetrator may be reduced or dispensed with if they notify the authorities of the criminal offence and reveal the circumstances of its commission before the authority becomes aware of them [6].

Explain the statute of limitations for the punishability of criminal offences.;yes;"The statute of limitations for criminal offences in Hungary is governed by the Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code. According to Section 26(1), liability to punishment shall become statute-barred after a period corresponding to the maximum of the penalty range, but at least after five years, unless otherwise provided in the Act excluding the statute of limitations for certain criminal offences [1]. 

There are exceptions to the statute of limitations, including:

- The limitation period is interrupted if the court, prosecution service, investigating authority, or, in a case with an international dimension, the minister responsible for justice or a foreign authority takes any criminal procedural act against the perpetrator due to the criminal offence [2].
- The statute of limitations regarding a criminal offence specified in paragraphs (1) to (4) shall commence on the day when the main case is finished [3].
- Members of authorities of foreign states pursuing any task relating to the administration of justice or law enforcement proceeding, under an Act, within the territory of Hungary, are subject to the provisions laid down in this section [4].

For criminal offences specified in Chapter XXVII, liability to punishment becomes statute-barred after twelve years [5]. However, liability to punishment shall not become statute-barred for criminal offences specified in Chapters XIII and XIV [6].

For damages caused by a criminal offence, the claim shall only lapse at the time when that criminal offence becomes no longer subject to punishment due to the lapse of time, if this period of time is longer than five years [7].

Exceeding the statute of limitations for criminal offences can result in the perpetrator being guilty of a felony and being punished by imprisonment for one to five years [8].
